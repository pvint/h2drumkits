=2) Installation=


If you dont want/can't to use a .deb package:

To use the Colombo hydrogen's drumkit:

You must make a dir into /usr/share/hydrogen/data/drumkits/ (or into your hydrogen's installation path)

As instance:
(Console command)
 mkdir /usr/share/hydrogen/data/drumkits/Colombo-Acustic-Drumkit

Then copy all the files to the new directory.

Console commands:
 cd /(your path to the samples & drumkit)

 cp *.* /usr/share/hydrogen/data/drumkits/Colombo-Acustic-Drumkit

Then you can use it with Hydrogen, just open this file from Hydrogen
/usr/share/hydrogen/data/drumkits/Colombo-Acustic-Drumkit/Colombo-Acustic-Drumkit-v1.h2song

or type

(Console command)
hydrogen /usr/share/hydrogen/data/drumkits/Colombo-Acustic-Drumkit/Colombo-Acustic-Drumkit-v1.h2song

=3) Recording details=

(7-4-2006)
Yesterday I was recording my acustic drum: it's not the best drum in the world, but you can get very nice sounds from it... it is a

* Colombo Percussion, handmade in Argentina circa 1970 to 1980

Similar to these models:

=Aesthetics=

I was not trying to get a "dry" sound: that's why added reverb to almost all of them.

The hihat and ride sounds have no extra reverb.

There is only one snare sample without extra reverb:
snare-opaque-2mics_normal-shot1.flac

(if you like it, I could make a new collection of dry samples)

I will make a "more wet" (adding some extra reverb) collection in the future, and maybe with another EQ/compression settings: it could be useful when you are making a Soundfont (.sf2) patch and you need your MIDI music to sound as it was already mastered.

By using the Hydrogen Drumkits, you can edit every single Instrument adding LADSPA plugins, so, maybe it's not a big deal to add some extra reverb to the sound samples files for now.

=Drums's measurement & details= 

Wooden toms, snare and bassdrum

Toms: 12X8 13X9 16X16 (hi, mid, low-foor)
Bassdrum: 21X14
Snare "piccolo" 14X4
Aquarian patch set. (¿parche se dice patch?)

Crash 16'' Sabian "B8 Pro, Thin Crash"
Crash 20'' Paiste 1000 "Power Crash 20''", made in Switzerland
Hihat Paiste 1000 14'' "Rude", made in Switzerland


=Room & equipment=

Recorded in my "acustic ready" room:

Mixer console: Phonic MU 802 (I have acces to better consoles such as Makie and Peavey, but this Phonic it's not so bad: it has Phantom Power too)
Mics: 6 Shure SM58 (I could borrow a Shure SM81 condenser Mic from a friend for the next time!)

=PC=

AMD Duron 1800, 128 RAM memory, 2 HD 30GB 7200RPM, SB Live!


=Software=

Operating System: Musix GNU+Linux 
Apps: Ardour, LADSPA, Rezound, Hydrogen

The sound samples were processed with Ardour & chained LADSPA plugins:

Multiband EQ
Gate
Fast Lookahead limiter
Caps: Versatile verb 2x2

Then, the samples were trimed with Rezound and saved as flac (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files.


=Future work=

The complete collection of .flac samples weight's it is about 12mb without the "shine" snares (that I did not finished yet, as you can listen).


=Mail me!=

If you make some music with this sounds, I will like to listen to it!
