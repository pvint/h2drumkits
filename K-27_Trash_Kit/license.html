<br><b><font face="Helvetica,Arial">Draft v1.1, 22 April 2001</font></b>
<p>
<b>I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS</b>
</p><p>
The OpenMusic works may be reproduced and distributed in whole
or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the
terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.
</p><p>
Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows: Copyright
(c) &lt;year&gt; by &lt;author's name or designee&gt;. This material may be
distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Green OpenMusic License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently
available at http://openmusic.linuxtag.org/). The reference must be
immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or
publisher of the work (see section VI). The refence must be
incoporated in any publication of the work, either physical or
electronic. If the work is broadcasted, or the reference can not be
incorporated by physical means, the reference can be ommitted with
prior permission obtained from the copyright holder.

</p><p>
Commercial redistribution of OpenMusic-licensed material is

permitted.
</p><p>

Any publication in physical form (like a CD) shall require the
citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and

author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the product. On
all outer surfaces of the product the original publisher's name shall
be as large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with
respect to the title.
</p><p>

<b>II. COPYRIGHT</b>
</p><p>

The copyright to each OpenMusic is owned by its author(s) or designee.
If the work covered by this license is bound to a specific transport

medium (see section VI), it is possible for the author(s) or designee
to publish the work on a different medium covered by a different

license.
</p><p>

<b>III. SCOPE OF LICENSE</b>
</p><p>

The following license terms apply to all OpenMusic works, unless
otherwise explicitly stated.

</p><p>
Mere aggregation of OpenMusic works or a portion of an OpenMusic work

with other works on the same media shall not cause this license to
apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice

specifying the inclusion of the OpenMusic material and appropriate
copyright notice.

</p><p>
SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable

in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in
force.

</p><p>
NO WARRANTY. OpenMusic works are licensed and provided "as is" without

warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited
to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a

particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.
</p><p>

<b>IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS</b>
</p><p>

All modified versions of works covered by this license, including
partial works incorporated into new works, must meet the following

requirements:
</p><ul>

<li>The modified version must be labeled as such.
</li><li>The person making the modifications must be identified and the

    modifications dated.
</li><li>The location of the original unmodified work must be identified.

</li><li>The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to
    assert or imply endorsement of the resulting work without the

    original author's (or authors') permission.
</li><li>The new work has to be released under precisely this

    License, with the modified version filling the role of the
    work, thus licensing distribution and modification of the

    modified version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
</li></ul>

<b>V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
and strongly recommended of redistributors that: If you are

distributing OpenMusic works in physical form, you provide email
notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least

thirty days before your media freeze, to give the authors time to
provide updated works. This notification should describe

modifications, if any, made to the work. All substantive modifications
(including deletions) be described in an attachment to the

work. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
considered good form to offer a free copy of any physical form

expression of an OpenMusic-licensed work to its author(s).
</p><p>

<b>VI. MEDIA LOCKING OPTION</b>
</p><p>

The author(s) and/or publisher of an OpenMusic-licensed document may
bind any publication of this work or derivative works in whole

or in part on a specific transport medium (for example "digital
distribution via the Internet"). Exceptions can be made with prior

permission from the copyright holder.
</p><p>

This option is selected by appending language to the reference to or
copy of the license. This option is considered part of the license

instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation
by reference) in derived works.

</p><p>
To accomplish this, add the phrase "Distribution of the work or

derivative of the work is restricted to &lt;insert medium here&gt; unless
prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder." to the

license reference or copy.
</p><p>
